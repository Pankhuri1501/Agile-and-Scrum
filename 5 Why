The 5 Whys Method (Root Cause Analysis)
The 5 Whys is a simple yet powerful problem-solving technique used to identify the root cause of a problem by repeatedly asking “Why?” at least five times. By peeling away the
layers of symptoms, this method reveals the underlying cause of an issue, enabling teams to address it effectively. It is a fundamental tool in Lean and Six Sigma methodologies.

Detailed Breakdown of the 5 Whys Method
1. Define the Problem
○ Objective: Start with a clear and concise statement of the issue at hand.
○ Problem Statement: Ensure that the problem is specific, measurable, and understood by everyone involved.
Example: “A customer’s order was delivered late.”

2. Ask the First Why
○ Objective: Identify the immediate reason the problem occurred.
○ Technique: Ask, “Why did this happen?”
Example: “Why was the order late?”
Answer: “The delivery truck left the warehouse late.”

3. Ask the Second Why
○ Objective: Dig deeper into the cause of the first answer.
○ Technique: Repeat the question, focusing on the reason behind the previous
Example: “Why did the truck leave the warehouse late?”
Answer: “The order was not prepared on time.”

4. Ask the Third Why
○ Objective: Probe further into the cause of the second answer.
○ Technique: Identify contributing factors that led to the delay.
Example: “Why was the order not prepared on time?”
Answer: “There was a shortage of staff in the warehouse.”

5. Ask the Fourth Why
○ Objective: Uncover deeper systemic or process-related issues.
○ Technique: Look for organizational or procedural factors.
Example: “Why was there a shortage of staff?”
Answer: “Several employees called in sick, and there was no contingency plan.”

6. Ask the Fifth Why
○ Objective: Get to the root cause that allows for meaningful corrective action.
○ Technique: Identify the foundational issue.
Example: “Why was there no contingency plan?”
Answer: “The warehouse does not have a staff backup policy.”

Analyze and Address the Root Cause
● Objective: Use the findings to develop actionable solutions.
● Key Considerations:
○ Ensure the identified root cause is actionable and within the team’s control.
○ Validate findings with data or evidence where possible.

Implement and Monitor Solutions
● Action Plan: Develop strategies to address the root cause.
Example: Create and implement a staff backup policy to ensure adequate coverage.
● Execution: Monitor the effectiveness of the solutions and ensure they prevent the recurrence of the issue.

Benefits of the 5 Whys
● Simplicity: Requires no special tools or techniques, making it easy for teams to adopt.
● Focus: Helps avoid jumping to conclusions or treating symptoms instead of causes.
● Efficiency: Quickly narrows down to actionable solutions.



The 5 Whys Method promotes a culture of inquiry, fosters collaboration, and leads to

sustainable solutions by addressing problems at their core.
