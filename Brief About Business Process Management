Quiz Answer Key
BPM is a discipline focused on the systematic improvement of an organization's business processes, aiming to align processes with strategic goals, improve efficiency, reduce costs, and enhance customer satisfaction. It's about understanding, managing, and continuously improving core business activities.

In the process discovery/analysis stage, the current state of identified processes is documented and analyzed. This involves mapping out the process steps, identifying bottlenecks and inefficiencies, and using techniques like process mapping and stakeholder interviews to gain a deep understanding of current operations.

A top-down approach starts with an organization's strategic goals and breaks them down into key processes, while a bottom-up approach begins with individual tasks and activities and groups them into processes. The former is useful for high-level strategic alignment, and the latter for uncovering hidden processes.

Swimlane diagrams are a type of flowchart that show which actor or department is responsible for each activity in a process. They are useful for visualizing cross-functional processes and identifying handoffs between different teams.

Three techniques for analyzing process problems are Root Cause Analysis (RCA), Value Stream Mapping, and SWOT Analysis. These methods help uncover the underlying causes of inefficiencies, waste, and strategic misalignments.

Lean Six Sigma combines Lean's focus on eliminating waste and improving flow with Six Sigma's emphasis on reducing process variation and defects. It provides a comprehensive approach to enhancing process efficiency and quality.

Business Process Reengineering involves a fundamental rethinking and radical redesign of business processes to achieve dramatic improvements in performance measures, such as cost, quality, service, and speed, often resulting in a complete overhaul of existing workflows.

The four stages of the PDCA cycle are Plan, Do, Check, and Act. These stages involve identifying improvement areas, implementing changes, evaluating their effectiveness, and adjusting the approach as needed to drive continuous improvement.

FMEA is a proactive method to identify and prioritize potential failure modes in a system or process. It uses the Risk Priority Number (RPN), calculated by multiplying severity, occurrence, and detection scores, to rank risks and prioritize actions.

Pareto Analysis is based on the principle that roughly 80% of the effects come from 20% of the causes, making it crucial to identify and focus on the few critical causes to achieve the most significant improvements.
